# Wall Message Service CDT
This project contains the CDT for group Julietts Wall Message Service.

## Overview
The project contains two Java classes: MessageRecord and CDTWallMessageService.

The MessageRecord class is a simple POJO which was stolen from the Skycave project. It is mainly used for the sake of 
simplicity.

The CDTWallMessageService class is the main class of the project. It contains the actual CDT for the Wall Message 
Service. Each test is structured after the Given-When-Then pattern.

The project is built using Gradle and JUnit 5.
